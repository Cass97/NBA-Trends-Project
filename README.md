# NBA-Trends-Project
This was an off-platform project as part of the "Summarising the Relationship Between Features" module in the Codecademy Data Science course. It was used for practical learning of Exploratory Data Analysis. It demonstrates the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and NumPy. These libraries were used to create mean differences, box plots, histograms, contingency tables and other tools for comparing two variables.
This is intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
